0.12.2 (2014-02-04)
===================

- CHANGE: BW2Package import file ignores warnings

0.12.1 (2014-02-04)
===================

New BW2Package format
---------------------

The new BW2Package is not specific to databases or methods, but should work for any data store that implements the DataStore API. This allows for normalization, weighting, regionalization, and others, and makes it easy to backup and restore.

0.12 (2014-02-04)
=================

**bw2-uptodate.py is required for this update**

Safe filenames
--------------

The algorithm to create filenames was changed to prevent illegal characters being used. See `utils.safe_filename`.

0.11 (2014-01-28)
=================

**bw2-uptodate.py is required for this update**

Upgrades to updates
-------------------

The update code filename was changed to ``updates.py``, and dramatically simplified. Code was organized and moved to an Updates class. All functionality was removed from utility scripts and ``bw2-uptodate.py``. Fresh installs should not have erroneous "updates needed" warnings.

Generic DataStore makes new matrices easy
-----------------------------------------

``data_store.DataStore`` defines a template for all data stores which could be processed into matrix data, and provides a lot of functionality for free. New objects subclass ``DataStore`` or ``ImpactAssessmentDataStore``, and need only define their unique data fields, metadata store, and validator. Abstracting common functionality into a simple class hierarchy should also produce fewer bugs.

Smaller changes
---------------

- BREAKING CHANGE: The filenames for LCIA methods are now derived from the MD5 of the name. This breaks all method abbreviations.
- BREAKING CHANGE: The filename and filepath attributes in SerializedDict and subclasses moved from ``_filename`` and ``filepath`` to ``filename`` and ``filepath``
- BREAKING CHANGE: Register for all data store now takes any keyword arguments. There are no required or positional arguments.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Database.process() doesn't raise an AssertionError for empty databases
- FEATURE: Database.process() writes a geomapping processed array (linking activity IDs to locations), in addition to normal matrix arrays.
- FEATURE: Tests now cover more functionality, and should allow for more worry-free development in the future.
- CHANGE: Database datasets are not required to specify a unit.
- CHANGE: The default biosphere database is no longer hard coded, and can be set in config.p['biosphere_database']. The default is still "biosphere".
- CHANGE: The default global location is no longer hard coded, and can be set in config.p['global_location']. The default is still "GLO".
- CHANGE: Ecospold 1 & 2 data extractors now only have classmethods, and these classes don't need to be instantiated. A more functional style was used to try to avoid unpleasant side effects.
